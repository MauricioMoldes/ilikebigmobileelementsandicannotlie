# Starfish Discovery

(previously: ilikebigmobileelementsandicannotlie)

## Group members

Jonah Cullen, Callum MacPhillamy, Mauricio Moldes, Alexis Norris, Meghana Ram, and Russel Santos

## Deliverables

1. Proof of concept that starfish works in non-fungi genomes (or doesnâ€™t) and maybe even discover something :)   
2. DNAnexus app for starfish 
3. Vizualization of starfish output in shiny app (general use -- not specific for our genomes)  

## Steps

![Flowchart v01](https://github.com/collaborativebioinformatics/ilikebigmobileelementsandicannotlie/blob/main/flowchart_2024-08-28-1444.png)


1. Get starfish to work (Jonah --> Marcus)  
2. Get data (genome, gene annotation, protein sequence, RepeatMasker annotation) for multiple species (Meghana: human, mouse; Alexis: pig, mouse; also Jonah's horse or dog?) 
3. Implement starfish code on DNAnexus (create app)
4. Generate R code for loading/viz data, use figshare code as starting point (Russel --> Mauricio --> Alexis) 
5. Wrap R code into Shiny app with `golam` (Jonah)
6. If we discover something in our genomes, follow-up on that :)
